My name is Kiran Shila and I am a working graduate student in electrical
engineering. I am currently working towards my PhD at Caltech with a focus on
cryogenic and room temperature LNAs for radio astronomy.

I am an avid functional programmer with my primary interests in scientific
computing with Julia, full stack development with Clojure(Script), and embedded
development in Rust.

In my free time, I like to hike, ski, backpack, and play the vibraphone.

I hope to use this site to document my projects and hobbies, thanks for reading!
